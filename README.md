# Incident Handler's Journal

## Objective
The Incident Handler's Journal project aimed to document and analyze a cybersecurity incident from detection to resolution. The primary focus was to provide a detailed account of the incident response process, showcasing best practices in incident management and communication among stakeholders. This project was designed to enhance the understanding of incident response frameworks and improve the ability to effectively manage security incidents in real-world situations.

### Skills Learned
- In-depth knowledge of incident response processes and frameworks (e.g., NIST, SANS).
- Proficiency in documenting incidents comprehensively and effectively.
- Ability to analyze incidents for root cause determination and impact assessment.
- Development of strategies for post-incident review and continuous improvement.

### Tools Used
- Documentation platforms (e.g. Google Docs) for creating detailed reports.

## Steps

### 1. **Initial Scenario**  

   Here, the initial scenario log details the first findings from the investigation where a U.S. health care clinic faced a ransomware attack after employees fell for phishing emails, installing malware. This led to encrypted files and disrupted operations. The clinic shut down systems and sought assistance to address the incident and restore access to critical patient data.

## Conclusion
This project enabled me to practice applying my documentation skills to complete a journal entry about a ransomware scenario. Accurate and thorough documentation is a critical aspect of my incident response because it helps to ensure that I do not lose or overlook important information. It also allows me to capture aspects of an incident for future use.
